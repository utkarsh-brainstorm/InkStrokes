# 🧪 CHAPTER 1 EVALUATION PROMPT:

## 📌 Prompt:

I have completed Chapter 1 (Line Work) of a foundational drawing course focused solely on outline, shape, and control. The goal was to develop clean, confident, and varied line work without relying on sketchy or fuzzy strokes.

Attached are 5 drawing responses as part of my evaluation. Please judge them *only* on the basis of line accuracy, confidence, and outline clarity — not shading, detail, or realism. Rate each image out of 10. 

Each drawing represents a test task from this chapter. Evaluate the following:

### ✏️ TEST QUESTIONS:

1. Draw a **metal spoon**, accurately and cleanly, from life. Show line weight subtly to reflect curvature and depth.
2. Create 4 **perfect ellipses** inside different angled boxes. Lines must be confident and one-pass.
3. Draw the **silhouette of a shoe** from two different angles. Focus on proportion and curve flow.
4. Produce a **gesture-based abstract line design** that demonstrates C-curve, S-curve, and flow rhythm.
5. Replicate a **simple mechanical object** (e.g., remote or charger) in pure outline form, using only 3–5 bold strokes per contour.
