### **🔎 Final Exam Questions**

---

### **1. Draw a Full-Body Human Figure from Imagination**

**Prompt:** A man or woman standing confidently, wearing light armor, holding a torch. No references. Construct with gesture + skeleton + form before detailing.

**Challenge**: Correct posture, proportion, foreshortening of arms/legs.

**Twist**: They should be facing ¾ towards you, not straight front or side.

🧠 *Tests*: Gesture flow, anatomy, balance, structure.

---

### **2. Still Life in 3-Point Perspective (Invented Scene)**

**Prompt:** Draw a study table corner in dramatic high or low angle (bird’s eye or worm’s eye) with objects like books, mug, lamp, pen, and a crumpled cloth.

**Use** 3-point perspective grids **only if drawn manually** (no digital tools).

**Challenge**: Light + shadow must clarify all volumes.

🧠 *Tests*: Spatial understanding, object interaction, complex perspective without distortion.

---

### **3. Portrait Drawing – Memory + Construction**

**Prompt:** Think of someone you've seen many times in real life (not a photo)—could be a friend, teacher, actor, or family member.

Draw their portrait using construction lines, then refine.

Add only light shadowing—focus on *structure* not rendering.

🧠 *Tests*: Memory recall, facial structure, mental model of features.

---

### **4. Create a Scene with Depth and Atmosphere**

**Prompt:** A traveler entering a mysterious forest with ancient ruins in background.

**Rules**:

- Use linear and atmospheric perspective
- Include 1 human, 3+ environment elements (rocks, trees, temple, mist)
- No tracing or copying references

🧠 *Tests*: Storytelling, composition, scale, depth illusion.

---

### **5. Abstract Composition with Solid Design**

**Prompt:** Create a purely abstract drawing using ONLY:

- straight lines
- geometric shapes
- black, white, and grey tones

Make it look *aesthetic*, not random. Think of balance, rhythm, tension.

🧠 *Tests*: Design thinking, layout, contrast, graphic design instincts.

---

### 💥 Anti-Cheat Measures

- No tracing, AI, or copying reference 1:1.
- References are *allowed* only for structural understanding, not copying shapes.
- You must *show all construction lines* on first 3 questions before erasing.
- Time yourself. Log each drawing’s time honestly. If you took 45 mins but it looks rushed, that’s on you.
